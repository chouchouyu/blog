		Hardy’s weakness/ derived from/ his apparent inability/ to control/ the comings and goings/ of these divergent impulses/ and from/ his unwillingness to/ cultivate and sustain/ the energetic and risky ones.
		no.3.
		Virginia Woolf’s /provocative statement/ about her intentions in writing Mrs. Dalloway/ has regularly been ignored/ by the critics，since it highlights/ an aspect of her literary/ interests very different from/ the traditional picture/ of the "poetic" novelist concerned with /examining states　of /reverie and vision/ and with following /the intricate pathways of/ individual consciousness.
